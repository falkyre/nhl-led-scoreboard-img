version:v1.8.2
detail:Latest scoreboard code that utilizes the nhl-api-py library with refactor from Araroth (to use the nhl-apy-py library) as well as weather fixes from me (falkyre).  Any boards related to playoffs or season countdown no longer work so take them out/don't add them to your config.  Image now built solely on bookworm.  Removed the zram config for the home directory and logs.  Added zram-swap (swap is now in ram instead of on your SD card).  Fixed the sb-upgrade tool to reference the virtual environment for the image so you can use that for future upgrades.  Fixed auto timezone setting to use the raspi-config (with no no interface)
